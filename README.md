# boltNetwork
### How to run
* Download this branch to your local machine 
* Go to this project's directory through terminal
* run on python's simple server (like : python -m SimpleHTTPServer)

### My localhost:8080 has been taken?

sudo npm install http-server -g

http-server


You should see some output like this:
Starting up http-server, serving ./
Available on:
http:10.0.1.7:8081

Then go to localhost:8081

## Why need server?
We need to process ajax in this project.
###
When you add routes to your app, ngRoute will make some behind-the-scenes AJAX requests to get the *templateUrl* file
